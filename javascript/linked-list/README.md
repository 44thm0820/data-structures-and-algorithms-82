# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Features

#### Node

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

#### Linked List
- Create a Linked List class
- Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
  - Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

- The class should contain the following methods
  - insert
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

  - includes
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: Boolean
      - Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

  - to string
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    - `"[ a ] -> [ b ] -> [ c ] -> NULL"`


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
insert is O(1), to string is O(n), includes is O(n) times.
