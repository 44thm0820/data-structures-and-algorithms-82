## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I followed the instructions given at https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Whiteboard_Workflow.html as my approach.  The big O is O(n/2) for small n, and roughly equal to O(n) as n approaches infinity.
