## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Code Challenge: Class 12

First-in, First out Animal Shelter.

## Features

- Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
- The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
- Implement the following methods:
  - enqueue
    - Arguments: animal
      - `animal` can be either a dog or a cat object.
  - dequeue
  - Arguments: pref
    - `pref` can be either "`dog`" or "`cat`"
  - Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
    - If `pref` is not "`dog`" or "`cat`" then return null.

## Stretch Goal

If a cat or dog isnâ€™t preferred, return whichever animal has been waiting in the shelter the longest.

## Requirements

Ensure your complete solution follows the standard requirements.

  1. Write [unit tests](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Challenge_Testing)
  2. Follow the [template for a well-formatted README](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Challenge_Documentation)
  3. Submit the assignment following [these instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Challenge_Submission)

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
