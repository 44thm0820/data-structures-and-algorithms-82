# Insert to Middle of an Array
<!-- # Insert and shift an array in middle at index -->
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Feature Tasks
- Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Specifications

- Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a public repository called `data-structures-and-algorithms`.
- Create a new branch in your repo called `array-insert-shift`.
- Make a directory for this challenge, named according to your language’s conventions, containing a README.md file.
- Update the “Table of Contents” - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge’s README file.
- **NOTE:** This challenge is **whiteboard only**
Write out code as part of your whiteboard process, but don’t worry about creating external program files.
Your final whiteboard should look like [this example layout](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Whiteboard_Workflow.html).

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I followed the instructions given at https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Whiteboard_Workflow.html as my approach.  The big O is O(n+1) for small n and O(n) for larger n.
