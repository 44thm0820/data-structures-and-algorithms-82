# Binary Search of Sorted Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## Feature Tasks
Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
**NOTE**: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.
Check the Resources section for details

### Specifications

- Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a public repository called `data-structures-and-algorithms`.
- Create a new branch in your repo called `array-binary-search`.
- Make a directory for this challenge, named according to your language’s conventions, containing a README.md file.
- Update the “Table of Contents” - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge’s README file.
NOTE: This challenge is whiteboard only
Write out code as part of your whiteboard process, but don’t worry about creating external program files.
Your final whiteboard should look like [this example layout](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Whiteboard_Workflow.html).

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I followed the instructions given at https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Whiteboard_Workflow.html as my approach.  The big O is O(1) for small n and O(n log n) for larger n.
